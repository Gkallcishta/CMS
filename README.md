Our project consists of a clinic management system. This software aims to help better manage the business, by making it easier to keep track of each patients' data and information. The Administrator will have access to everything in this software. He/she will add new employees, give them access to the system, as well as manage their login credentials. The Human Resource specialist can add new employees as well as make monthly job evaluations . The Receptionist will register new patients and leave them an appointment to a specific doctor, as well as generate receipts. The doctors will be able to check or update each of their patients' information with the help of this software. The financier will take care of salaries, and inventory as well. 
Each action performed by the staff will be appeared on the software and will be seen by the administrator as well.
